# Spotify_ML
Problem Statement:
This project is centered around analyzing a dataset of various tracks on the music
platform Spotify. The dataset includes information such as track names, artists, release dates,
presence on playlists and charts, stream counts, and various musical properties like beats per
minute (bpm), danceability, mood, energy, and more. The core problem our team is addressing
involves exploring relationships and patterns within this rich dataset to understand the factors
contributing to a song's popularity and success on streaming platforms.
Application of Data Science Algorithms for Business Value
1. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): The team proposes to use EDA methods to delve into the
dataset and uncover underlying patterns. For example, examining the relationship between the
speed (bpm) of a song and its perceived danceability, or assessing the impact of presence on
Shazam charts on streaming counts.
2. Regression Analysis: To understand correlations between different variables, regression
analyses are planned. For instance, using bpm as an independent variable and danceability as
a dependent variable, or studying the effect of the month a song is released on popularity
ranking as an example.
4. Visualization: Visualization methods such as scatter plots, regression plots, and potentially 3D
scatter plots will be used to represent data patterns and relationships visually. This approach
aids in better understanding complex data interactions and can guide more informed business
decisions in the music industry.
5. Predictive Modeling: The project suggests using regression models to predict streams based
on various factors like playlist inclusions and chart presence. Comparing RÂ² and MSE values
from different regression models will help understand which factors are more significant
predictors of streaming success.
